# memegen
Funny minecraft meme generator

Please don't look at the embarrassingly messy code

# Usage
`pip install opencv-python moviepy pyttsx3` to install dependencies, too lazy to write a requirements.txt
`python3 main.py` generates a meme and an .mp3 file of the caption in tts.
`python3 video.py [num]` where num is the number of memes inserted into the video generates a video containing multiple memes with obnoxious music in the background and a text to speech narrator.
